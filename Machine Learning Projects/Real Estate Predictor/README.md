# Real Estate Price Prediction

Real Estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions.

## Process Overview

Below is a structured approach we can follow for real estate price prediction, aiding individuals and businesses in navigating the complexities of the real estate market:

### 1. Data Collection

Aggregate pertinent data from diverse sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and both public and private repositories.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Streamline and prepare the amassed data by addressing missing values, eliminating outliers, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Introduce new features or refine existing ones to encapsulate crucial information capable of influencing real estate prices effectively.

### 4. Data Exploration and Visualization

Investigate and visually represent the data to glean insights into its distribution, correlations, and underlying patterns, aiding in understanding the nuances of the real estate market dynamics.

### 5. Model Selection

Opt for suitable machine learning algorithms or predictive models tailored to the specific task of real estate price prediction, considering factors such as model complexity and interpretability.

### 6. Model Training

Train the chosen model on the training data, fine-tuning its parameters to enhance its predictive accuracy, thereby empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on reliable forecasts.
