This is a simple Python script that allows users to play a guess the number game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and the user needs to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed.

#**How to Use**
Clone the repository or download the guess_the_number.py file.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the script using the command python guess_the_number.py.
Follow the instructions to guess the number.

#**Implementation Details**
The script uses the random.randint() function to generate a random integer between 1 and 10.
It prompts the user to enter a number and provides feedback based on the comparison with the generated random number.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

#**Example Usage**
bash
Copy code
$ python guess_the_number.py
Enter any number between 1 and 10: 5
