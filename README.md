## Background
Hello, 
My name is Megha Komarraju, and I am a highly skilled Data Scientist with a proven track record of delivering impactful results, particularly in the realm of machine learning. Leveraging my extensive experience from roles at NICE Systems, Janus Henderson Investors, and Franklin Templeton Investments, I possess a compelling blend of financial acumen, project management expertise, and technical proficiency. I have successfully applied machine learning techniques to optimize business processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive strategic initiatives. Additionally, I have a strong background in building and maintaining reports, KPI dashboards, and analytics pipelines using tools like SQL, Looker, Alteryx, and Tableau. My ability to lead cross-functional teams and effectively communicate complex insights further underscores my commitment to driving organizational success through data-driven decision-making. As a transformational leader driven by challenges and committed to excellence, I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in machine learning to make a meaningful impact in your organization.

Now, I am currently focusing on analyzing our day to day problems, predicting the outcomes as well as contributing solutions to the society as I can. I am a firm believer of the quote 'Without data you are just another person with opinion"- W. Edwards Deming
